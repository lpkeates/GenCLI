# About
A Generic Command Line Interface that I have used for a personal project. Feel free to remix!

# Getting Started
This section is mainly for when you want to make your own version. Keep in mind that some of the modules I use are optional.

### Prequesites
Required:
* cmd (complimentary of Python)
  ```sh
  import cmd
  ```
Optional:
* wikipedia (Python 2.6+/3.3+)
  ```sh
  pip install wikipedia
  ```
* Any other modules you like
  ```sh
  pip install <module>
  ```

### Installation
Since this is project is just a demo of what I have been doing, the main way to do such is via the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lpkeates/GenCLI.git
```

### Usage
In order to run GenCLI, you will need to do the following command:
```sh
python cli.py
```
*The filename is whatever you want to name it. The default is `cli.py`*

### Notes
If you want to use the RPG function, you are welcome to. Just insert the code into the CLI file, and edit it however you want. If you want to go a step further, feel free.

# License
You are free to use this project for whatever you want, but please don't use it illegally!
