# About
A Generic Command Line Interface that I have used for a personal project. Feel free to remix!

# Getting Started
This section is mainly for when you want to make your own version. Keep in mind that some of the modules I use are optional.

### Prequesites
Required:
* pycli (Python 2.4+)
  ```sh
  pip install cmd
  ```
Optional:
* wikipedia (Python 2.6+/3.3+)
  ```sh
  pip install wikipedia
  ```
* Any other modules you like
  ```sh
  pip install <module>
  ```

### Installation
Since this is project is just a demo of what I have been doing, the main way to do such is via the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lpkeates/GenCLI.git
```

### Usage
In order to run GenCLI, you will need to do the following command:
```sh
python cli.py
```
*The filename is whatever you want to name it. The default is `cli.py`*
